# ccd2iso
Utility to convert CloneCD .img file to a .iso file.

Original utility can be found here: [ccd2iso](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ccd2iso/),  a
project by Danny Kurniawan and Kerry Harris. This current for is forked from [this repository](https://github.com/jkmartindale/ccd2iso), 
owned and 'mantained' by jkmartindale, his fork added some more error handeling and progress bar. 
This current fork's goal is to make it easier to select files and fix errors which have occured in past few years.

This is still work in progress, so I don't recommend using this just yet.
